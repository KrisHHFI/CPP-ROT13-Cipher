### Launch the App

1) Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2) Navigate to the file folder. Then: CPP-ROT13-Cipher.exe

### About

- The app is my first published C++ code. It is based on my other program "ROT13_Nodejs", which was written in JavaScript.
- Created in 2023. 
- The security level of ROT13 is poor.
